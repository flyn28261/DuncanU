<P>If you're using the VOR correctly, then the dot in the center
is your airplane, and the line is the course you're trying to
be on. If the line is to the right, go right. If the line is to
the left, go left.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;A VOR has three elements: an omnibearing selector (OBS),
    a course deviation indicator (CDI), and a TO/FROM indicator.</P>

    <P>The OBS allows you to select the line of direction that the
    VOR tracks.</P>

    <P>The CDI indicates how many degrees the aircraft is off that
    line, and in which direction.</P>

    <P>The TO/FROM indicator shows whether following that line's
    direction would take you to that ground facility, or away from
    it.</TD>

    </FONT></B>If the aircraft is not on the line, the CDI shows
    a deviation of one dot for every two degrees. Think of the center
    dot as being the aircraft, and the CDI as being the line you
    want to be on. If the line is to the right of the dot, get back
    on it by turning right (as in the example's red aircraft). IMPORTANT:
    if you are flying away from the VOR station, and the indicator
    says TO, you will get reverse sensing: the line will be on the
    wrong side. This is the situation with the blue aircraft in the
    example: if that plane goes right, toward the CDI needle, it
    will get farther away from the radial line. The same is true
    if you are flying toward the station, and the indicator says
    FROM.</TD>

    where you are, find two ground facilities that will give you
    a good angle between them. Tune each in, and center the needles
    with a FROM indication. You are on the intersection of those
    two radials. (If you have only one VOR, then you'll have to flip
    between their frequencies and recenter.) In this example, the
    plane is at the intersection of the RED 074&ordm; radial, and
    the GRN 157&ordm; radial.</TD>

    below).</P>

    <P>To fly from one VOR to another, fly away from one VOR with
    the needle centered on the appropriate radial and a FROM indication.
    You can put exactly the same radial into the VOR you're approaching,
    and it will also line up with a TO indication. If you have only
    one VOR, switch between the frequencies at the half way point.</TD>

<P><CENTER>Intercepting a radial is a matter of choosing the angle
at which you wish to get on the line, and then doing some utterly
simple math.</CENTER></P>

<P><TABLE WIDTH="870" BORDER="2" CELLSPACING="20" CELLPADDING="0">

    <TD WIDTH="50%">
    <P>&nbsp;The most rapid way to get on to a distant radial would
    be to fly perpendicular, straight to it: a 90&ordm; intercept.
    To intercept a 270&ordm; TO course from the south, fly direct
    north until the needle centers. To intercept that same line (which
    would also be the 90&ordm; FROM radial) from the north, fly directly
    south.</P>

    BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></TD> 
    <TD WIDTH="50%">
    <P>Usually, though, you'll want to intercept a course at a shallower
    angle, because that cuts down the total distance and time to
    your destination. 30&ordm; or 45&ordm; are good intercept angles,
    but any angle will do and the math is always the same: take the
    magnetic course of the line that you're trying to get on. Then,
    if you're intercepting from the right side of the line, add the
    intercept angle. If you're intercepting from the left of the
    line, subtract the intercept angle.</P>

    <P><B><U>Example:</U></B> You're trying to intercept the 280&ordm;
    course (TO the station) from south of that line. You choose a
    30&ordm; intercept. Fly a track of (280&ordm; + 30&ordm;) = 310&ordm;.
    If you are trying to intercept that same line from the north
    side, on a 45&ordm; intercept, fly a track of (280&ordm; - 45&ordm;)
    = 235&ordm;. If you were going to fly FROM on that same line,
    it's the 100&ordm; radial. To intercept at a 45&ordm; angle from
    the north, you're now on the left side of the line, so fly (100&ordm;
    + 45&ordm;) = 145&ordm;. Note that the track is not necessarily
    the heading: you'll have to crab for wind in order to intercept
    correctly.</TD>

    <P>Bracketing is the craft of getting and staying on a direct
    track to a navigation facility, by making adjustments for wind
    drift. The idea is this: get on the line and hold a heading.
    The wind pushes you off the track. Pick a heading to get back
    to the line, and then split the difference. Repeat until you
    find the heading that holds the CDI steady, straight up and down.</TD>
